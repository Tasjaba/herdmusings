This is a quick and dirty example for a path generation script.

Try it out:
Drag mouse to generate path.
- PathSetter class is what you want to look at. (In scripts dir)
- Look in the scene view to see the waypoint objects.
  - They are children of the PathSetter object.
  - You can modify the WP prefab to show a mesh too.
- Play around with how the particles look by modifying the particle systems.
